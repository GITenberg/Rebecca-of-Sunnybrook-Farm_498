description: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children's novel\
  \ by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her\
  \ two stern aunts in the fictional village of Riverboro, Maine. Rebecca's joy for\
  \ life inspires her aunts, but she faces many trials in her young life, gaining\
  \ wisdom and understanding. Wiggin wrote a sequel, New Chronicles of Rebecca. Eric\
  \ Wiggin, a great nephew of the author, wrote updated versions of several Rebecca\
  \ books, including a concluding story. The story was adapted for the theatrical\
  \ stage, and was filmed three times, once with Shirley Temple in the title role.\n\
